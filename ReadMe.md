# nipype folder

- This is a main `nipype` folder and `nipype` conda environment.
- I am going to install `jupyter-pelican` here to see how my static blogs works.

# Installing pelcan using help from [here](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-1.html).

 1. pip install markdown
 2. pip install pelican
 3. pip install fabric3
 4. pip install bs4
 5. pip install ghp-import
